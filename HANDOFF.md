## What mello is (60-second context)

**mello.ai** is a B2B SaaS — a 24/7 AI voice receptionist for sports & recreational facilities (turfs, gyms, court complexes) in India. It answers every inbound call, understands **Hindi + English code-switching**, checks live availability, enforces booking rules (membership, groups, etc.), and confirms via WhatsApp in ~30 seconds.

Three products under one platform:
- **Mello Voice** — the AI phone receptionist
- **Mello Book** — the booking rules engine + admin dashboard
- **Mello Chat** — WhatsApp confirmations / reschedules

**Market:** India-first (Mumbai/Navi Mumbai launch). Pricing in ₹. Positioning: globally capable, India-launched. The moat is bilingual code-switching that global voice bots (Bland, Retell, Synthflow) can't do.

**User (you talking to):** Harshit. Solo / small team founder. Non-technical but decisive. Calendly: `connect2harshit123/30min`.

## Current state

### Marketing website ✅ SHIPPED
- Live at: **https://mello-omega.vercel.app**
- GitHub: **https://github.com/harshit-1243/mello** (`main` branch)
- Stack: **Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v3 + GSAP + Lenis + Geist**
- All 10 sections from `BUILD_PROMPT.md` are present with real copy
- Cinematic motion (pinned hero scrub, kinetic split-text, custom cursor, magnetic CTAs, rounded overlapping stage/paper sections, kinetic marquee, Statement display-xl beat)
- Reduced-motion fallbacks honoured throughout
- Vercel auto-deploys on every `git push origin main`
- All `Book a Demo` CTAs → `SITE.CALENDLY_URL` in `src/lib/site.ts`

### Voice agent — Steps 1–8 SHIPPED (in `agent/server/`)
Full bilingual voice agent works end-to-end. Stack: **Fastify + TypeScript**, all
models from **Sarvam** (STT `saaras` streaming, LLM `sarvam-105b`, TTS `bulbul:v3`
`ritu`), telephony via **Twilio Media Streams**, persistence in **Supabase**.
- Flow: Twilio call → `<Connect><Stream>` → `/voice/stream` WS → μ-law→PCM →
  Sarvam STT → brain (`sarvam-105b` + 6 tools) → Sarvam TTS (μ-law 8k) → caller.
- **Browser test console at `GET /test`** — chat with Mello + hear her, no phone needed.
- Booking-rules engine: availability, member-only windows + T-30 release, group
  ±2h conflict, court abstraction — DB-backed (Supabase), config fallback.
- Privacy: audio never stored · 90-day transcript purge · audit log · per-facility
  isolation · `delete_my_data`.
- Lots of behavioral hardening done (language matching, decline/insist handling,
  closed/past/unsupported-sport, court-leak fix, error resilience).
- Run it: `cd agent/server && npm run dev` → http://localhost:8080/test
- See `agent/server/README.md` for full details.

### Pending
- **Step 10.3 (NEXT):** dashboard auth — Supabase magic-link + per-facility RLS (dashboard is currently OPEN). 10.1 (pages) + 10.2 (live data) ✅ DONE. **Step 11:** learning loop.
- Step 9 ✅ done (WhatsApp confirmation + Razorpay link, graceful stubs). Needs WhatsApp + Razorpay creds in `.env.local` to actually send/charge.
- **Twilio number** — KYC pending; blocks the live PHONE demo (test console works now).
- Logo (user prefers streetwear / Jordan Jumpman energy, NOT abstract painting NOT M-monogram)
- `/privacy` and `/security` pages on the marketing site (discussed, not built)

## Hard architectural decisions (don't re-litigate)

These were debated and decided. Don't reopen unless user asks:

1. **Tailwind v3, not v4.** We deliberately downgraded from the scaffold. Token-based via `tailwind.config.ts` + CSS vars in `globals.css`. Do NOT suggest `@theme inline` or v4 syntax.
2. **Multi-tenant SaaS, not per-client custom builds.** ONE codebase, ONE deployment, each facility = one row in a DB. NEVER "fork the code for this client."
3. **Privacy = "Trusted Processor" model**, not E2E encryption. Data stays in India · audio destroyed in 60s · transcripts 90 days · audit logs · per-facility isolation · never sold or shared. Internal model training on bookings is allowed (this-facility scope). Do NOT propose E2E or "we can't read it" claims.
4. **21st.dev Magic MCP doesn't work reliably here** — keeps timing out / redirecting. Hand-build components. Don't suggest invoking it.
5. **Claude Code's `preview_screenshot` keeps timing out** because the preview window reports `visibilityState: hidden` — browser pauses the compositor. Use `scripts/shot.mjs` (puppeteer-core + installed Chrome) instead. Tested + reliable.
6. **Logo style: streetwear/Jumpman silhouette energy.** User rejected: abstract brushstrokes, M-monograms, waves/soundbars, AI-cliché sparkles, geometric primitives.
7. **Voice agent: speaks ENGLISH FIRST**, switches to Hindi if caller does. Never identifies as AI unless directly asked.
8. **Court abstraction:** Mello NEVER says court numbers during a call ("Court 1 is open" is banned). The system silently assigns a court. Court # only appears in the WhatsApp confirmation.
9. **All-booked policy:** if a sport is fully booked at a time, suggest a different TIME for the same sport — NEVER a different sport.
10. **Group conflict + member-only + external platform** rejections all just say "booked." No reasons given to caller.
11. **LLM brain = Sarvam, not OpenAI.** Sarvam's chat API (`sarvam-30b` / `sarvam-105b`, legacy `sarvam-m`) is OpenAI-compatible and supports `tools` / `tool_choice` function calling — confirmed in the SDK types. Chosen over OpenAI because: one vendor (already signed up, free tier, one key), Indian-built so stronger on Hindi/Indic + code-switching (the moat), and data stays in India (aligns with privacy decision #3). OpenAI account stays as a fallback only. Default `sarvam-105b` + reasoning=medium (30B was slower AND off-persona in testing).
12. **"Learning from calls" is a DATA PIPELINE, not live model training.** We use a hosted LLM (Sarvam) — you can't retrain it per call. The privacy rule grants the RIGHT to use this-facility data; the mechanism is: store (Step 7) → improve prompt/examples/memory (Step 11) → optional fine-tune later. Don't promise "the model learns on every call" literally.
13. **LiveKit vs Sarvam is NOT either/or — different layers.** Sarvam = the models (STT/LLM/TTS). LiveKit = real-time orchestration/plumbing (WebRTC, turn detection, barge-in) that USES providers like Sarvam. Voice quality is a TTS choice (Sarvam v3 ritu chosen — best for India/Hindi/data-residency), NOT something LiveKit fixes. LiveKit only helps the PLUMBING latency + adds barge-in; it can't speed up the LLM tool-call time (the biggest chunk). Decision: keep Sarvam+current stack for the demo; consider LiveKit for production polish later (it can still run Sarvam underneath).
14. **Dashboard = "Dark command-center" + light toggle** (pivoted 2026-06-11 from "Hybrid"). Dark default. Palette: green primary + **amber** secondary + white numbers. Do NOT revert to all-light Hybrid. Theming is via channel CSS vars scoped to `#dash-root` — keep marketing site untouched.
15. **Dashboard analytics = REAL metrics only, NO gimmicks, NO price references.** User explicitly rejected sentiment analysis, "Hindi accuracy", uptime %, and "Mello health" vanity stats. Also: NEVER show a subscription price (e.g. "for ₹4,999/mo") anywhere — **pricing is per-facility and will change** (see `payment-provider-swappable` memory). Show value as raw outcomes (revenue booked, missed calls recovered), never divided by a price.
16. **Dashboard shows DEMO seed by default pre-launch** (`DASHBOARD_LIVE` env, default OFF) so it looks alive with no real facility. Live Supabase reads are fully wired and flip on with `DASHBOARD_LIVE=1`. Don't delete the live loaders — they're correct, just gated.
17. **Audio is NEVER played back in the dashboard.** Audio isn't stored (60s destroy, decision #3). Any "waveform audio player" in a design mock is impossible/banned — transcripts only. (The animated waveform in the live rail is decorative CSS, not real audio.)

## The demo facility — Raheja Ileseum

Mumbai sports facility. Used to build + demo Phase 1.

### Quick facts (full data in `agent/facilities/raheja-ileseum/config.json`)
- Hours: 8 AM – 12 AM (midnight)
- Sports: badminton (3 courts), tennis (1), pickleball (3), basketball (1, splittable into 2 halves)
- Pricing per hour (non-members): badminton ₹600, tennis ₹1200, pickleball ₹600, basketball full ₹1600 / half ₹800
- **Members pay ₹0.**
- Member-only windows: 8–10 AM and 9–11 PM all 7 days. **Release 30 min before start** if unbooked.
- Slots: min 30 min, default 1 hr, multiples of 1 hr, max 4 hr.

### Members (real numbers for live demo)
| Name | Phone | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Harshit | +91 83698 51507 | standard |
| Manan | +91 96536 79703 | standard |
| Bitu | +91 89760 19902 | standard |
| Kush | +91 84796 41500 | standard |
| Krit | +91 89375 04721 | standard |
| Rahul | +91 98765 43210 | placeholder (fake) |

### Groups
- **G1:** Harshit, Manan, Bitu
- **G2:** Kush, Krit, Bitu
- Bitu in both — intentional, sets up the demo's group-conflict catch.

### Group conflict rule (very specific)
If any group member books sport X at time T, no other group member can book sport X (any court) within **±2 hours of T** (start time only). Different sports unaffected. Different days unaffected.

### Demo seed bookings (in `config.json`)
- **Seed #1:** Hudle external booking, badminton tomorrow 8 PM (enables Hudle-conflict demo)
- **Seed #2:** Bitu's booking, badminton tomorrow 8 PM (enables group-conflict demo)
- **Seed #3:** disabled by default; toggle on for "all 3 courts booked → suggest different time" demo

### Customer-facing rules (all encoded in `system-prompt.md`)
- Never identify as AI unless asked
- English greeting first, switch to Hindi if caller does
- **Never mention specific court numbers** during a call
- All courts booked → suggest different time, **never different sport**
- Member-only slot when unavailable → just *"unavailable"*, NEVER *"members only"*
- Group conflict → just *"booked"*, NEVER mention groups or names
- External (Hudle/Khelomore) conflict → just *"booked"*, NEVER name the platform
- Never quote price to a member
- Non-member payment: ask Razorpay-link via WhatsApp OR pay at venue
- Amenity questions (parking/lockers/food/coaching) → graceful callback via `escalate_to_human`
- Always `check_availability` + `check_group` before `create_booking`
- Always summarize booking before confirming, wait for explicit yes

---

## The build sequence (Phase 1 — pre-launch prototype)

1. ✅ Marketing website (shipped)
2. ✅ Agent config + system prompt for Raheja Ileseum (user-approved v2)
3. ✅ **Twilio webhook handler** — `agent/server/` (Fastify + TS). `/voice/incoming` greets then opens a Media Stream. Twilio creds are placeholders in `.env.local` (KYC + auth pending).
4. ✅ **Sarvam STT integration** — `/voice/stream` WebSocket receives Twilio media (μ-law 8kHz), converts to PCM (`src/audio/mulaw.ts`), forwards to Sarvam streaming STT (`src/voice/sttBridge.ts`), logs transcripts. Auto-detect language for code-switching. Verified locally with a simulated media stream (frames received + counted; μ-law decode matches G.711 reference). **Needs `SARVAM_API_KEY` in `.env.local` to actually transcribe** — boots & counts frames without it.
5. ✅ **Sarvam LLM brain** — `src/brain/agent.ts` runs the Sarvam chat loop (`sarvam-105b`) with `system-prompt.md` as system message + the 6 tools (`src/brain/tools.ts`). Booking-rules engine `src/booking/engine.ts` implements availability, member-only windows + T-30 release, group ±2h conflict, court assignment — seeded from `config.json`. **14/14 rule checks pass** (deterministic, no key needed). Caller phone passed via Stream `<Parameter>` so tools can't be spoofed. **LIVE-VERIFIED** against the real Sarvam API: group-conflict scenario handled perfectly (offered alt time same sport, no leak). Key is in `.env.local`.
6. ✅ **Sarvam TTS** — `src/voice/ttsBridge.ts`. Brain reply → Sarvam streaming TTS (`bulbul:v2`, speaker `anushka`) configured to output **μ-law @ 8kHz directly** (Twilio's native format — zero conversion/resampling). Audio re-chunked to 160-byte frames and streamed back over the same WS as outbound `media`. Greeting moved from placeholder `<Say>` to TTS. **Verified end-to-end locally**: simulated Twilio call → greeting synthesized & 165 media frames (~3.3s) streamed back. Full loop (STT→brain→TTS) complete. Only the real phone leg is untested (needs Twilio number).
7. 🟡 **Supabase DB — capture layer DONE, read-path pending.** Schema `agent/server/db/schema.sql` (facilities, members, groups, group_members, bookings, call_logs, transcripts, tool_calls, audit_log; RLS enabled). DB client `src/db/client.ts`, persistence `src/db/persistence.ts` (call logs + transcripts + tool calls + audit — the LEARNING-LOOP capture layer), seed `src/db/seed.ts` (`npm run db:seed`). Wired into the agent (startSession/endSession, per-turn transcript + tool-call logging). **Graceful: no creds → in-memory seed, demo still works.** STILL TODO: swap the BookingEngine READ path (members/availability) from config.json to Supabase so bookings persist across calls; per-facility RLS policies (with Step 10 dashboard auth). Needs user's SUPABASE_URL + SERVICE_KEY.
8. ✅ **5 privacy rules** — audio never persisted (stream-through only); transcripts 90-day TTL + `purgeExpiredTranscripts` (boot + daily, `src/db/persistence.ts`); audit_log wired (call_started, deletes, purges); per-facility isolation (facility_id + RLS); right-to-delete via `delete_my_data` tool (`deleteCallerData`) + `deleteFacilityData()` ready for the dashboard. Verified delete flow + audit entries live.
9. ✅ **WhatsApp confirmation + Razorpay link** — `src/notify/` (whatsapp.ts, razorpay.ts, confirmation.ts). After a confirmed `create_booking`, the server fires a fire-and-forget WhatsApp confirmation (THE only place the court number appears — never spoken). `send_payment_link` now creates a real Razorpay Payment Link and delivers it over WhatsApp. Graceful: no `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`/`WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID` → message is LOGGED not sent; no Razorpay keys → placeholder link. `engine.createBooking` now returns `amount` (members ₹0; non-members rate×hours, basketball full/half). Smoke-verified (₹600 badminton, ₹0 member tennis, ₹800 basketball half). Needs from user (NOT blocking): Meta WhatsApp token + phone-number-id (sandbox OK) and Razorpay test keys → paste into `.env.local`.
10. 🟡 **10.1 + 10.2 DONE, 10.3 (auth) NEXT** — Facility owner dashboard. Lives in the Next app under `/dashboard` (nested layout; custom-cursor + Lenis disabled there). **Pages:** Overview, Calls list, Call detail (transcript bubbles + tool-call trace + booking card w/ court + privacy delete), Bookings, Members, **Reports** (NEW), Settings. Data layer = `src/lib/dashboard/{data,format,live,db}.ts`.
   - **VISUAL DIRECTION PIVOTED (2026-06-11): now "Dark command-center" with a light toggle** (was Hybrid). Default **dark**, sun/moon toggle top-right (no-flash, `localStorage` key `mello-theme`). Theme works via **channel CSS vars** (`--c-*` R G B) in `globals.css` → Tailwind tokens (`ink/paper/line/green/signal/amber/...`); `[data-theme="dark"|"light"]` set on **`#dash-root` only** (marketing site untouched). Palette: green primary + **amber** secondary (resolved/play/money) + white numbers. `stage`/`on-stage` stay hardcoded-dark (live rail). See memory `dashboard-direction.md`.
   - **10.2 live data DONE:** `getOverview/getSettings/getReports/getCalls/getCall/getBookings/getMembers` all read live Supabase (`live.ts`) with seed fallback. BUT the dashboard **defaults to rich DEMO seed** (`USE_LIVE = process.env.DASHBOARD_LIVE === "1"` in `data.ts`, default OFF) because there's no real facility yet — set `DASHBOARD_LIVE=1` to read live. (The "paid vs pay-at-venue" stat was dropped — no backing column; replaced with member/non-member split.)
   - **Reports page** (`/dashboard/reports`): real analytics only — call→booking conversion, after-hours calls caught, demand-by-hour, bookings-by-sport, member mix. **No gimmicks** (no sentiment/Hindi-accuracy/uptime) and **no price references** (pricing per-facility + changes). "Before vs after Mello" panel reads a baseline from `facilities.config.baseline.missed_per_month` (collected post-deal); demo seed sets it so the panel shows.
   - **Test Mello REMOVED from the product** (deleted `/dashboard/test` + `/api/test`) per user. It survives ONLY on the `dashboard-demo` branch (the public demo deploy).
   - **DEPLOYS:** `main` → marketing project `mello-omega.vercel.app` (dashboard at `/dashboard`). Separate Vercel project **`mello-dashboard-demo`** tracks the **`dashboard-demo`** branch (env `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=1`, scripted Test Mello, seed-only) — note it still has the OLD hybrid look until someone ports the dark theme onto that branch.
   - STILL TODO: **10.3** Supabase magic-link auth + per-facility RLS (dashboard is currently OPEN). Order locked by user: pages → Supabase → auth. Once auth lands, make dashboard pages dynamic (currently static-prerendered). **See `TESTING_NOTES.md`** for the end-to-end test guide.
11. ⏳ **Per-facility learning loop** (uses Step 7's captured transcripts/tool_calls/outcomes). NOT live model training — it's: (a) prompt/example refinement from real call patterns, (b) per-facility memory (common requests, demand times, dialect quirks) fed as context, (c) optional fine-tuning ONLY if Sarvam supports it. Privacy: this-facility scope, audited, 90-day transcript TTL. See decision #3 + #12.

### Tool functions (IMPLEMENTED — `src/brain/tools.ts`, run by `dispatchTool`)
- `verify_member(phone)` → `{ is_member, name?, tier? }`
- `check_slot(sport, date, start_time, duration_minutes?, basketball_mode?)` → `{ available, alternative_times, reason? }` — **ONE combined call** (availability + member-window + T-30 + external + group conflict). Replaced the old separate check_availability + check_group (latency win). `reason` ∈ closed/past/too_far_ahead/unknown_sport (public, explainable); absent = "booked" (private).
- `create_booking({name, phone, sport, date, start_time, duration_minutes?, basketball_mode?})` → `{ booking_id, status }` (court is HIDDEN from the model — only in WhatsApp). Persists to Supabase.
- `delete_my_data()` → `{ deleted }` — caller right-to-delete.
- `send_payment_link(phone, amount, booking_id)` → `{ link_sent }` — ✅ Step 9: real Razorpay link delivered over WhatsApp (graceful without keys).
- `escalate_to_human(reason, callback_phone)` → `{ scheduled }` — **STILL A STUB** (wire when dashboard/notifications exist).

### Hosting plan (DECIDED)
- **Demo stage = laptop + ngrok (free).** Run `agent/server` locally, expose with
  `ngrok http 8080`, point Twilio's webhook at the ngrok URL. Full real-time
  capability, zero hosting bill. Use this for the client demo.
- **After demo succeeds → Railway** (~₹400/mo, always-on). Same server, no rewrite.
- **Vercel is OFF the table for the voice backend** — confirmed again with user.
  Serverless can't hold the persistent WebSocket needed for real-time Sarvam
  STT/TTS streaming (Steps 4–6). Vercel stays for the marketing site only.
- DB: **Supabase** (Postgres + auth + row-level security — good for per-facility isolation)

---

## How the user likes to work

- **Announce before each step.** They asked: *"tell me what you are building at that moment before you start so I can keep a track."* Always preface implementation with a short "I'm about to do X — here's why".
- **Present choices clearly so they can pick.** Use tables, numbered options, brief explanations. Avoid open-ended questions when a 3-option pick would work.
- **No walls of text.** They scan. Use headings, bullets, tables.
- **They're non-technical but smart.** Don't dumb down — explain unfamiliar things briefly the first time, then assume comprehension.
- **They sometimes paste screenshots with concerns.** Look carefully — they're usually right about something being broken/wrong.
- **They write lowercase casually.** Don't mistake this for low effort.
- **They use the AskUserQuestion pattern well.** Use it when you genuinely need a decision, not for trivial things.

---

## Known gotchas / dev environment quirks

- **OneDrive sync** makes file watching flaky. Sometimes `.next/` cache gets corrupted across rebuilds — delete it: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next`
- **Multiple node processes** can pile up holding port 3000. Kill: `Get-Process node | Stop-Process -Force`
- **Dev server cold-start** can take 30-60s on first request due to OneDrive paths. Warm it up with a request before screenshotting.
- **PowerShell on Windows** is the shell. Pipeline chain `&&` / `||` are NOT available. Use `; if ($?) { ... }`. Don't use Unix `head` / `tail` — use `Select-Object -First N` / `-Last N`.
- **Headless screenshots:** use `scripts/shot.mjs` with env vars:
  ```
  URL=http://localhost:3000/  W=1440  H=900  FULL=1  REDUCED=1  OUT=scripts/shots/x.png  node scripts/shot.mjs
  ```
  `REDUCED=1` emulates `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` so animations are skipped and everything renders statically (best for screenshots). Set `REDUCED=0` to capture motion mode.
- **For motion screenshots that need scroll**, use `scripts/shotmotion.mjs` (not committed — re-create if needed; uses puppeteer `page.mouse.wheel`).
- **GSAP + CSS transform pre-hides DON'T MIX.** Use `opacity: 0` for FOUC guards on elements GSAP will animate via `transform`. Mixing them stacks transforms → element stays stuck offscreen. (Cost us 1 hour to debug — see commit `11d7994`.)
- **Hydration**: `WaveBars` uses `.toFixed(2)` on its computed widths because `Math.sin` differs at last-ULP between Node and browser, which caused React hydration warnings.

## Git workflow

```powershell
git add -A
git commit -m "describe the change"
git push origin main   # triggers Vercel deploy
```

Vercel deploys in ~1-2 min. Hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) to bypass browser cache.

`.gitignore` excludes: `/.next/`, `/scripts/shots/`, `/scripts/*.log`, `/public/logos/`, ad-hoc dev scripts, `.claude/settings.local.json`.

## Immediate next step (when user resumes)

**Step 10.3 — dashboard auth (Supabase magic-link + per-facility RLS).**
10.1 (pages) + 10.2 (live data) are DONE. The dashboard is currently OPEN — auth
is the last piece before it can be public on real data. Order locked: pages →
Supabase → auth. After auth: switch dashboard pages from static-prerender to
dynamic, and flip `DASHBOARD_LIVE=1` so they read the signed-in facility's rows.

### Step 10 — facility dashboard (10.1 + 10.2 DONE) 🟢→🟡
- **Visual direction = "Dark command-center" + light toggle** (PIVOTED 2026-06-11
  from Hybrid). Default dark; sun/moon toggle (`ThemeToggle.tsx`, top-right,
  no-flash via inline script in `dashboard/layout.tsx`, `localStorage` key
  `mello-theme`). Theming = channel CSS vars (`--c-*`) → Tailwind tokens, scoped
  to `#dash-root` via `[data-theme]` so marketing stays light. Green + **amber**
  + white. Memory: `dashboard-direction.md` updated.
- **All pages BUILT + live-wired** (seed fallback): Overview, Calls, Call detail,
  Bookings, Members, **Reports**, Settings.
- **Dashboard shows DEMO seed by default** (`USE_LIVE` flag OFF in `data.ts`) so
  it looks alive pre-launch. Live rail animates (amber play button + waveform +
  ticking timer). Set `DASHBOARD_LIVE=1` for live Supabase.
- **Reports** = real analytics only (conversion, after-hours caught, demand-by-
  hour, sports, member mix) — no gimmicks, no price refs. Before/after panel uses
  `facilities.config.baseline.missed_per_month`.
- **Test Mello DELETED from product** (`/dashboard/test` + `/api/test` gone);
  lives only on the `dashboard-demo` branch.
- **STILL TODO:** **10.3 auth** (Supabase magic-link + per-facility RLS —
  REQUIRED before the dashboard is public; it's currently open) → then dynamic
  rendering + `DASHBOARD_LIVE=1`.

### Latency — tuned this session
- The bottleneck was **non-streaming TTS in the test console** (~2.3s), NOT the
  brain (~2s/turn at `medium`). The greeting (zero LLM) was ~5s = pure TTS.
- Fix: **text-first console** (reply shows in ~2s, voice loads in background) +
  mute toggle. Real phone path was already fast (streaming TTS ~0.3s + filler).
- `SARVAM_REASONING_EFFORT` stays **medium**: `low` wasn't faster (TTS-bound) and
  skipped the confirm-before-book step. (Tested A/B.)
- Sarvam free tier intermittently times out under rapid load (~60s) — transient.
  Future win: stream LLM tokens → TTS sentence-by-sentence (bigger change).

### Concurrency — verified + hardened this session
- **The agent handles concurrent calls.** `handleTwilioStream` gives every call
  its own isolated scope (own CallAgent, history, engine, WS). No shared mutable
  state. Node serves many I/O-bound calls on one instance. Verified live: 3
  simultaneous test sessions stayed fully separate.
- **Double-booking race FIXED:** `saveBooking` now (1) pre-checks the exact
  court/date/start and (2) relies on a DB UNIQUE index as the airtight backstop;
  on conflict, `dispatchTool` rolls back the in-memory booking (`engine.
  removeBooking`) and returns `unavailable` so Mello offers another time. Verified
  deterministically (1st save `saved`, 2nd same-slot `conflict`).
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED:** run `agent/server/db/migrations/001_booking_slot_unique.sql`
  in the Supabase SQL editor to activate the DB-level backstop (the app pre-check
  works without it; the index is the exact-simultaneous guarantee).
- Real ceiling at scale = **Sarvam paid tier** (free throttles concurrency).

### WhatsApp — tested LIVE this session ✅
- Sandbox token + phone-number-id added; **delivery confirmed** (template + a
  free-form confirmation both arrived on +91 83698 51507).
- ⚠️ Two gotchas: the sandbox **token expires ~24h** (grab a fresh one from Meta
  API Setup when it 401s with code 190); and free-form messages only deliver
  inside the **24h window** (message the test number first). **Production needs a
  pre-approved utility template** — switch `sendBookingConfirmation` to a template.

### Step 9 — DONE ✅
WhatsApp confirmation (Meta Cloud API) + Razorpay payment link. Built the same
graceful way as everything else (works with stubs, goes live when creds added):
- `src/notify/whatsapp.ts` — `sendWhatsApp(log, toPhone, message)` via Meta Cloud
  API (POST graph.facebook.com). No `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`/`WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID` → LOGS
  the message instead of sending. Never throws.
- `src/notify/razorpay.ts` — `createPaymentLink(log, {amountInr, bookingId, phone})`
  hits the Payment Links API (amount ×100 → paise, `expire_by` from
  `RAZORPAY_LINK_VALIDITY_MINUTES`). No keys → placeholder `rzp.io/i/demo-<id>` link.
- `src/notify/confirmation.ts` — `buildConfirmationText()` (THE only place the
  court number surfaces), `sendBookingConfirmation()`, `sendPaymentLink()`. Nice
  formatting: "Today/Tomorrow/Mon, 12 Jun" + "7–8 PM". Members get no price line.
- `engine.createBooking` now returns `amount` via a private `priceFor()` helper
  (members ₹0; non-members rate×hours; basketball full/half rates).
- Wired in `dispatchTool`: after a confirmed `create_booking`, fire-and-forget
  `sendBookingConfirmation(...)` SERVER-SIDE (court stays out of speech).
  `send_payment_link` → Razorpay link → WhatsApp (phone from call ctx, not the
  model — unspoofable).
- New env vars: `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID`, `WHATSAPP_API_VERSION`
  (default v21.0), `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`,
  `RAZORPAY_LINK_VALIDITY_MINUTES`. Flags: `whatsappConfigured`, `razorpayConfigured`.
- Verified: `tsc --noEmit` clean + smoke test (₹600 badminton, ₹0 member tennis,
  ₹800 basketball half; court only in WhatsApp text).

Needs from user to go LIVE (NOT blocking — it logs/placeholders without them):
Meta WhatsApp app (token + phone-number-id; sandbox is fine) and Razorpay test
keys → paste into `agent/server/.env.local`.

### What's already wired vs stubbed (so you don't redo it)
- ✅ Persistence (call_logs, transcripts, tool_calls, bookings, audit_log) — live in Supabase.
- ✅ `delete_my_data`, transcript purge, audit logging.
- ✅ `send_payment_link` = real Razorpay link over WhatsApp (Step 9; graceful without creds).
- ✅ WhatsApp booking confirmation fires server-side after `create_booking` (Step 9).
- 🔌 `escalate_to_human` = stub returning `{scheduled:true}` → wire when dashboard/notifications exist (Step 10).

### Test console + latency + voices (added after Step 6)
- **Browser test console** at `GET /test` (served by the agent server). Chat with
  Mello + hear her, no phone/Twilio needed. Runs the real brain+tools+engine;
  per-message voice dropdown. Files: `src/tester/page.ts`, `src/tester/synth.ts`
  (non-streaming TTS → WAV for browser). Routes in `index.ts`.
- **Voice = bulbul:v3 `ritu`** (env `SARVAM_TTS_SPEAKER`, default ritu) on BOTH
  live calls and the test console. We switched the live path from v2 *streaming*
  to **v3 non-streaming** (`textToSpeech.convert`, output_audio_codec mulaw @
  8000) because v2 voices sounded robotic/mispronounced English (dropped letters);
  v3 is much cleaner. Cost: ~1.5s reply-gen vs ~0.3s streaming → masked by a
  PRE-CACHED filler (`warmFillers` at boot). Good v3 voices: ritu/priya (F),
  rohan/amit (M); others can sound robotic so the console dropdown is curated.
  User picked **ritu** and wants it on the real product, not just demo. ✅
  NOTE: v3 streaming isn't supported by the SDK, hence non-streaming.
- **Measured latency (server-side, brain→voice):** TTS time-to-first-audio ~0.28s
  (excellent). Brain: ~0.8–1.5s simple turns; ~4–5s on turns needing
  availability+group tool hops (multi-round-trip). Add STT endpointing (~0.5–1s)
  + network (~0.3–0.6s) → end-to-end perceived ~2–3.5s simple, ~6–7s booking-logic
  turns. **105B + reasoning=medium chosen** (30B was slower AND ignored the
  persona; reasoning=low flubbed the conflict turn). Both tunable via env.
- **Latency roadmap (not done):** (a) speak a short filler ("ek sec…") while tools
  run; (b) combine check_availability+check_group into ONE tool to halve hops on
  the slow path; (c) stream LLM tokens to TTS sentence-by-sentence. Do these if
  the demo feels sluggish.

### Demo readiness note
The agent is fully functional NOW via laptop + ngrok — the ONLY blocker to a live
phone demo is a **Twilio number** (KYC pending; a temp US number works). Once a
number exists: `ngrok http 8080`, point the number's voice webhook at
`https://<ngrok>/voice/incoming`, and call it. STT on real speech + Twilio
playing the audio are the only things not yet exercised (no real call made yet).

### Still pending from the user (not blocking the build)
- **Twilio credentials** — Account SID + Auth Token (KYC + auth still pending). Paste into `agent/server/.env.local` when ready.
- **Phone number** — Indian KYC not cleared. For the demo, a temp US number (~$1/mo, no KYC) works; swap later.
- **Sarvam API key** — ✅ **ADDED** to `agent/server/.env.local` (free tier). Powers STT, the LLM brain, and TTS. NOTE: env loads `.env.local` first then `.env` (see `src/env.ts`) — `dotenv/config` alone would've missed it. Brain was **live-verified** end-to-end: Manan→7PM badminton→group conflict caught→offered 5PM same sport, code-switched to Hindi, never leaked the group/name. 🎉

### Decisions locked this session
- Backend = TypeScript on Node (Fastify). ✅
- Hosting = laptop + ngrok for the demo (free), Railway after. Vercel NOT for voice. ✅
- STT = Sarvam streaming (`speechToTextStreaming`, auto-detect language) to keep code-switching. NOT the translate resource. ✅
- LLM brain = Sarvam chat API (`sarvam-105b`), NOT OpenAI. One vendor, India-resident, tool-calling confirmed. ✅

## Files to read first (priority order)

1. **`HANDOFF.md`** (this file)
2. **`agent/facilities/raheja-ileseum/system-prompt.md`** (the agent's behavior)
3. **`agent/facilities/raheja-ileseum/config.json`** (the facility data)
4. **`src/lib/site.ts`** (constants)
5. **`BUILD_PROMPT.md`** (original brief — only if marketing-related question)

That should give you full context in <5 minutes. Now ask the user what they want to do, or proceed with the next step above if they say "continue."

*Last updated: end of session that built the marketing site, deployed to Vercel, and created the agent config + system prompt v2.*
